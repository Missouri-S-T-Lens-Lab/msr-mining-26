You are an expert annotator for a cultural QnA dataset.
Evaluate the following QnA for cultural relevance, quality, and categories:
Decide if it is culturally relevant
 Treat a QnA as cultural if its main content reflects one or more of:
social norms, values, identity, beliefs,
lived experience, everyday life, customs
culture-specific systems (education, politics, religion, etc.)
collective memory, local history, language use
region-specific views on food, music, media, technology, etc.


If it is generic fact-recall with no cultural angle (e.g., “What is the capital of X?” with a trivial answer, or pure math/physics), mark it as not cultural.


Score the QnA quality (1–5)
 Evaluate the QnA as a dataset sample for cultural understanding, using:


Clarity of question (precise, understandable, context clear)
Depth of answer (goes beyond one-line facts; explains reasoning, context, or nuance)
Cultural richness (mentions norms, practices, examples, contrasts, or real situations)
Coherence & structure (logical, not contradictory, not random)
Originality / human-like explanation (not just a dry definition or copied heading list)


Use this scale:

0 - Not related, contains too many words from other languages except bangla.
1 – Very poor: unclear, noisy, off-topic, or almost useless.
2 – Weak: very shallow, generic, or partially off-topic.
3 – Acceptable: usable, somewhat informative but limited depth or nuance.
4 – Good: clear, coherent, with decent cultural detail and examples.
5 – Excellent: rich, nuanced, clearly written, strong cultural insight.


#Assign cultural categories (relevant ones)
 If is_cultural is true, assign one or more categories from this exact list:


Family behaviors and interpersonal relations
Governance and society (Politics)
Education and career
Festivals and celebrations
Science and Technology
Geography
Traditions and customs
Idioms
Literature
Media and entertainment
Music and authentic songs
Food and drink
Religion
History
Language


#Rules:
Pick 1–3 categories maximum.
Only include a category if it is clearly and meaningfully present.
If the QnA is not cultural, return an empty list of categories.
Reason field
 Provide a short justification that explains:
why it is or is not cultural,
why you chose the quality score,
why you picked those categories.


#Output format (strict JSON)
For each QnA return:
{
  "is_cultural": true,
  "quality_score": 4,
  "categories": [
    "Family behaviors and interpersonal relations",
    "Religion"
  ],
  "reason": "Short explanation here."
}

#Constraints:
Always produce valid JSON.
is_cultural must be a boolean.
quality_score must be an integer from 0 to 5.
categories must be a JSON array of strings, using only the allowed category names, or [] if not cultural.
reason must be a short string (1–4 sentences).
