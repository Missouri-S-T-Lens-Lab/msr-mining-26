claude_code	https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/pull/191	Step 1: Create base infrastructure for MCPProxyService extraction	## Summary    This PR creates the foundational infrastructure for extracting MCP transport management logic into a reusable service. This is the first step in a multi-part refactoring to improve code organization and maintainability.    ### Changes Made    • **Created shared infrastructure directory** (`server/src/shared/`)  • **Added TypeScript interfaces** for ServerConfig, MCPProxyOptions, ConnectionStatus, and Logger  • **Implemented utility functions** for session generation, configuration validation, and logging  • **Added comprehensive documentation** explaining the architecture and design decisions    ### Key Components    - `types.ts`: Core interfaces for configuration and status tracking  - `utils.ts`: Helper functions and console logger implementation  - `README.md`: Detailed documentation of the MCP Proxy Service architecture  - `index.ts`: Public API exports for the shared module    ### Benefits    - **Improved code organization** by separating transport logic from route handling  - **Type safety** with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces  - **Extensibility** for adding new transport types in future steps  - **Maintainability** through centralized configuration and error handling    ### Next Steps    This PR sets up the foundation for:  1. Step 2: Implementing TransportFactory class  2. Step 3: Creating MCPProxyService class   3. Step 4: Refactoring main server to use the new service    🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)    Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>	closed	Abandoned/not reviewed	Non-Functional PR
claude_code	https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/pull/2307	Fix: Resolve browser multiplication issue in Puppeteer MCP server	## Problem  The Puppeteer MCP server was creating multiple Chrome browser instances with each tool call instead of reusing existing instances, leading to resource exhaustion and performance issues.    ### Symptoms  - Chrome process count growing with each Puppeteer tool call  - System resource exhaustion (memory, CPU)  - Performance degradation over time  - Multiple browser windows opening in non-headless mode    ## Root Cause  The `ensureBrowser()` function had several critical issues:  1. **Flawed browser restart logic**: New browsers were launched without properly closing existing ones  2. **No browser health validation**: Dead browser instances were not detected  3. **Missing process cleanup**: Orphaned Chrome processes accumulated  4. **Race conditions**: Multiple concurrent tool calls could trigger multiple browser launches    ## Solution  This PR implements a comprehensive fix with the following improvements:    ### 1. Browser Health Monitoring  - Added `isBrowserHealthy()` function to validate browser connectivity and responsiveness  - Checks both connection status and ability to retrieve pages with timeout protection    ### 2. Launch Concurrency Protection  - Implemented `browserLaunching` flag to prevent concurrent browser launches  - Ensures only one browser launch can occur at a time  - Subsequent calls wait for the launch to complete    ### 3. Enhanced Graceful Cleanup  - Improved browser closing with 5-second timeout protection  - Falls back to process-level cleanup if graceful close fails  - Added 500ms delay after cleanup to ensure proper resource release    ### 4. Process Signal Handlers  - Added handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and uncaught exceptions  - Ensures proper cleanup on server shutdown  - Prevents orphaned processes on unexpected exits    ### 5. Chrome Process Cleanup  - Implemented `cleanupChromeProcesses()` to kill orphaned Chrome instances  - Uses platform-specific commands to ensure cleanup  - Called on both normal and error paths    ## Testing  Tested the fix extensively:  - ✅ Multiple rapid tool calls (navigate, screenshot, evaluate)  - ✅ Verified stable browser count (no multiplication)  - ✅ Tested server restart scenarios  - ✅ Confirmed backward compatibility  - ✅ All existing functionality preserved    ### Before Fix  - Started with 6 Chrome processes  - After 4 tool calls: 15 processes  - After 7 tool calls: 15+ processes (continuously growing)    ### After Fix  - Stable at 15 processes regardless of tool call count  - Proper reuse of existing browser instance  - Clean shutdown with no orphaned processes    ## Breaking Changes  None - this is a backward-compatible bug fix that maintains all existing APIs and behavior.    ## Notes  - The fix is applied to the TypeScript source in the `archive-servers` branch  - The compiled JavaScript output has been tested and verified  - The same issue likely affects the npm-published version of `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer`    🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)    Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>	closed	Unwanted feature	Incorrect Implementation
claude_code	https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/pull/1371	Add DeciLM/Nemotron-NAS architecture support	## Summary  This PR introduces native MLX support for DeciLM architecture models, including NVIDIA's Nemotron series that use Neural Architecture Search (NAS) optimizations.    ## Motivation  The Nemotron models represent a significant advancement in LLM efficiency through NAS optimization, but were previously incompatible with MLX due to their unique architecture featuring dummy layers and variable attention configurations. This PR enables running these massive models (up to 253B parameters) on Apple Silicon.    ## Key Features  - ✅ Support for dummy layers (no-op attention/FFN components that pass input unchanged)  - ✅ FFN fusion for improved efficiency (multiple FFN layers combined into wider parallel layers)  - ✅ Variable Grouped Query Attention (VGQA) with different number of KV heads per layer (1-8)  - ✅ Block configuration handling for NAS architectures  - ✅ Full conversion pipeline from HuggingFace to MLX format  - ✅ Comprehensive test suite    ## Tested Models  - **nvidia/Llama-3_1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1**    - Q5 quantization: 3.86 tokens/sec generation on M3 Ultra   - Memory usage: ~175GB peak   - Pre-converted model available: [LibraxisAI/Llama-3_1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1-mlx-q5](https://huggingface.co/LibraxisAI/Llama-3_1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1-mlx-q5)  - Compatible with other DeciLM-based models    ## Implementation Details  The implementation handles the unique NAS architecture through:  1. `DummyAttention` and `DummyFFN` classes that implement no-op layers  2. Per-layer configuration loading from `block_config.py`  3. Proper weight mapping during conversion  4. Support for variable attention heads per layer    ## Performance  On Mac Studio M3 Ultra (512GB RAM):  - Nemotron-253B Q5: ~3.86 tokens/sec generation  - Prompt processing: ~27-35 tokens/sec  - This replaces the need for 2x A100/H100 GPUs ($60k+ hardware)    ## Testing  All tests pass. The test suite includes unit tests for dummy layers, block configuration, and conversion logic.    🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)    Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>	closed	Unwanted feature	Abandoned / Not Reviewed

copilot	https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/pull/7744	Fix GenerateDocumentationFile to respect DisableXmlDocs configuration	## Summary    Fixes an issue where ref docs were not appearing in IntelliSense from generator libraries due to an inconsistency between the `DisableXmlDocs` configuration and the `GenerateDocumentationFile` project property.    ## Problem    The `GenerateDocumentationFile` property was hardcoded to `true` in `NewProjectScaffolding.cs`, but it didn't respect the `DisableXmlDocs` configuration setting. This created an inconsistency where:    1. When `DisableXmlDocs=true`, XML docs are not written to source code  2. But `GenerateDocumentationFile=true` was still set in project files  3. This caused the compiler to try to generate documentation files from source code that has no XML docs, resulting in no IntelliSense documentation    ## Solution    Changed `NewProjectScaffolding.cs` to respect the `DisableXmlDocs` configuration:    ```csharp  // Before  GenerateDocumentationFile = true,    // After   GenerateDocumentationFile = !CodeModelGenerator.Instance.Configuration.DisableXmlDocs,  ```    ## Changes    - **Fixed** `NewProjectScaffolding.cs` to conditionally set `GenerateDocumentationFile` based on `DisableXmlDocs`  - **Added** comprehensive unit tests in `CSharpProjectWriterTests.cs` to validate project file generation  - **Added** integration tests in `NewProjectScaffoldingIntegrationTests.cs` to validate end-to-end behavior    ## Test Coverage    - 3 unit tests for `CSharpProjectWriter` behavior with different `GenerateDocumentationFile` values  - 2 integration tests for `NewProjectScaffolding` with both `DisableXmlDocs=true` and `DisableXmlDocs=false`  - All existing tests continue to pass (no regressions)    ## Result    Now the generator correctly sets:  - `GenerateDocumentationFile=true` when `DisableXmlDocs=false` (default), enabling IntelliSense documentation  - `GenerateDocumentationFile=false` when `DisableXmlDocs=true`, maintaining consistency    This ensures that generated libraries properly produce documentation files for IntelliSense when XML docs are enabled.

copilot	https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/pull/14760	Fix scroll wheel responsiveness in Windows App SDK by using system scroll settings	"## Problem    Scroll wheel behavior in React Native Windows using the new architecture (Windows App SDK) was significantly less responsive compared to the WinUI 3 Gallery app and other native Windows applications. Users reported that scrolling felt sluggish and required much more effort, with fewer lines scrolled per wheel notch than expected.    ## Root Cause    The `OnPointerWheelChanged` method in `ScrollViewComponentView.cpp` was using the raw mouse wheel delta (typically 120 per notch) multiplied only by `pointScaleFactor`, completely ignoring Windows system settings for wheel scroll behavior that users configure in their system preferences.    ## Solution    This PR implements system-aware scroll wheel calculation that respects Windows user preferences:    1. **Added `GetSystemWheelScrollLines()` helper function** that retrieves the user's configured ""lines per wheel notch"" setting using `SystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETWHEELSCROLLLINES, ...)`    2. **Updated scroll calculation** to use proper line-based scrolling:   ```cpp   // Before: Raw delta approach   scrollDown(-delta * m_layoutMetrics.pointScaleFactor, true)      // After: System-aware line-based approach    const float notches = delta / 120.0f;   const float linesToScroll = notches * systemLinesPerNotch * c_scrollerLineDelta * m_layoutMetrics.pointScaleFactor;   scrollDown(-linesToScroll, true)   ```    3. **Math comparison**:   - **Before**: 120 pixels per notch (regardless of user preferences)   - **After**: ~48 pixels per notch with default 3-line setting, ~80 pixels with 5-line setting   - Properly scales with DPI and respects user's accessibility needs    ## Benefits    - ✅ **Responsive scrolling**: Matches native Windows application behavior  - ✅ **User preference aware**: Respects system scroll wheel settings  - ✅ **Accessibility friendly**: Works with custom line counts for users with mobility needs  - ✅ **DPI aware**: Maintains proper scaling on high-DPI displays  - ✅ **Minimal impact**: Only 7 lines of code changed, no breaking changes    ## Testing    Validated the mathematical logic with various scenarios:  - Standard 3-line setting: 48 pixels per notch  - High accessibility 5-line setting: 80 pixels per notch   - High DPI (1.5x): 72 pixels per notch with 3-line setting  - Backward scrolling: Proper negative values    Fixes #14653.    > [!WARNING]  >  > <details>  > <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>  >  > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:  >  > - `googlechromelabs.github.io`  > - Triggering command: `/usr/local/bin/node install.mjs ` (dns block)  > - `https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/130.0.6723.116/linux64/chrome-headless-shell-linux64.zip`  > - Triggering command: `/usr/local/bin/node install.mjs ` (http block)  > - `https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/130.0.6723.116/linux64/chrome-linux64.zip`  > - Triggering command: `/usr/local/bin/node install.mjs ` (http block)  >  > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:  >  > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled  > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)  >  > </details>"	closed	Non-Functional PR	CI/Test Failure
copilot	https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/pull/7418	Add ESLint pre-commit hook to ensure code quality	This PR enhances the existing pre-commit hook to include ESLint checks, ensuring that TypeScript and TSX code adheres to the project's linting rules before commits are allowed.    ## Changes Made    - **Enhanced `.husky/pre-commit`**: Added ESLint validation that runs automatically on staged TypeScript/TSX files  - **Performance optimized**: Only runs ESLint on staged files matching `*.ts` and `*.tsx` patterns  - **Respects existing configuration**: Uses the same `.eslintrc.json` config and exclusion patterns as the existing `npm run lint` script  - **Maintains existing workflow**: Preserves all current hygiene checks that run after ESLint validation    ## Implementation Details    The pre-commit hook now:    1. **Identifies staged TypeScript/TSX files** excluding `src/env/browser/` files (matching existing lint script behavior)  2. **Runs ESLint validation** on those files using the project's standard configuration  3. **Provides clear feedback** when ESLint errors are found and prevents the commit  4. **Gracefully skips ESLint** when no relevant files are staged  5. **Continues with existing hygiene checks** after ESLint passes    ## Example Output    When ESLint finds issues:  ```  Running ESLint on staged files...  /path/to/file.ts   3:30 error Strings must use singlequote quotes   7:9 error Unexpected var, use let or const instead no-var    ESLint failed. Please fix the errors before committing.  ```    When no TypeScript files are staged:  ```  No TypeScript/TSX files staged for commit, skipping ESLint.  ```    This ensures code quality is maintained at commit time while preserving the existing development workflow and all current code quality checks.    <!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->    Created from VS Code via the [GitHub Pull Request](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension.    <!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->  ---    💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

copilot	https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/pull/1109	Fix slice bounds panic in addPropertyToElementList for reverse-mapped properties	## Problem    A panic was occurring in `addPropertyToElementList` with the error:  ```  panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [:-1]  ```    The issue happened when processing reverse-mapped properties that also required placeholders. The code would:    1. Check if a property is reverse-mapped (`propertyIsReverseMapped = true`)  2. Skip pushing to `reverseMappedStack` when `shouldUsePlaceholderForProperty()` returns `true`  3. Still attempt to pop from the stack using the original `propertyIsReverseMapped` condition  4. Panic when trying to slice an empty stack with `[:-1]`    ## Root Cause    In the `addPropertyToElementList` function, the push and pop operations on `reverseMappedStack` were asymmetric:    ```go  // Push operation (only executed in else branch)  if propertyIsReverseMapped {   b.ctx.reverseMappedStack = append(b.ctx.reverseMappedStack, propertySymbol)  }    // Pop operation (always executed if propertyIsReverseMapped is true)  if propertyIsReverseMapped {   b.ctx.reverseMappedStack = b.ctx.reverseMappedStack[:len(b.ctx.reverseMappedStack)-1] // PANIC!  }  ```    When `shouldUsePlaceholderForProperty()` returned `true`, the push was skipped but the pop still occurred.    ## Solution    Replace the `propertyIsReverseMapped` condition for popping with a `pushedToStack` flag that tracks whether we actually pushed to the stack:    ```go  pushedToStack := false  if propertyIsReverseMapped {   b.ctx.reverseMappedStack = append(b.ctx.reverseMappedStack, propertySymbol)   pushedToStack = true  }  // ... type processing ...  if pushedToStack {   b.ctx.reverseMappedStack = b.ctx.reverseMappedStack[:len(b.ctx.reverseMappedStack)-1]  }  ```    This ensures we only pop from the stack if we previously pushed to it, preventing the slice bounds panic.    ## Testing    Added comprehensive test cases that exercise:  - Complex recursive mapped types that trigger reverse mapping  - JSX scenarios matching the original stack trace  - Deep nesting that causes placeholder logic to activate  - Error scenarios that force type-to-string conversion during error reporting    All tests pass and verify the fix prevents the panic while maintaining correct behavior.

copilot	https://github.com/hyperxpro/Brotli4j/pull/217	Implement resource leak logging for DecoderJNI and EncoderJNI finalize methods	This PR addresses the TODO comments in `DecoderJNI` and `EncoderJNI` classes by implementing proper resource leak logging in their finalize methods.    ## Problem  The finalize methods in both `DecoderJNI.Wrapper` and `EncoderJNI.Wrapper` contained TODO comments about logging resource leaks:  - `/* TODO: log resource leak? */` in DecoderJNI  - `/* TODO(eustas): log resource leak? */` in EncoderJNI    When native resources are not properly destroyed (i.e., `destroy()` method not called explicitly), the finalize method would silently clean up without any indication to developers that a resource leak occurred.    ## Solution  Added WARNING level logging using standard `java.util.logging` when resource leaks are detected in the finalize methods. The implementation:    - Uses `java.util.logging.Logger` (no additional dependencies required)  - Logs clear warning messages instructing developers to call `destroy()` explicitly  - Only logs when `context[0] != 0` (indicating undestroyed native resources)  - Maintains all existing functionality without breaking changes    ## Changes Made  - Added static Logger instances to both Wrapper classes  - Replaced TODO comments with proper logging implementation  - Added necessary imports for `java.util.logging.Level` and `java.util.logging.Logger`    ## Example Output  When a resource leak is detected, developers will now see:  ```  WARNING: Brotli decoder not properly destroyed. Native resources may leak. Call destroy() method explicitly to avoid this warning.  ```    ## Testing  - All existing tests pass (17/17 successful)  - Custom verification test confirms logging works correctly  - Warning messages appear during test execution, demonstrating real-world effectiveness  - Clean build and compilation successful across all modules    ## Benefits  - Improves debugging capability for resource leaks  - Helps developers identify when they forget to call `destroy()` explicitly   - Provides actionable guidance in warning messages  - Zero performance impact on normal operation  - Maintains backward compatibility    This is a minimal, surgical change that significantly improves the developer experience when working with Brotli4j native resources.    > [!WARNING]  >  > <details>  > <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>  >  > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:  >  > - `dlcdn.apache.org`  > - Triggering command: `/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-17-jdk-amd64/bin/java -classpath /home/REDACTED/work/Brotli4j/Brotli4j/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar -Dmaven.multiModuleProjectDirectory=/home/REDACTED/work/Brotli4j/Brotli4j org.apache.maven.wrapper.MavenWrapperMain clean compile` (dns block)  > - `repository.sonatype.org`  > - Triggering command: `/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-17-jdk-amd64/bin/java --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -classpath /usr/share/apache-maven-3.9.10/boot/plexus-classworlds-2.9.0.jar -Dclassworlds.conf=/usr/share/apache-maven-3.9.10/bin/m2.conf -Dmaven.home=/usr/share/apache-maven-3.9.10 -Dlibrary.jansi.path=/usr/share/apache-maven-3.9.10/lib/jansi-native -Dmaven.multiModuleProjectDirectory=/home/REDACTED/work/Brotli4j/Brotli4j org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.launcher.Launcher clean compile` (dns block)  >  > If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:  >  > - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled  > - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)  >  > </details>        <!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->  ---    💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

copilot	https://github.com/Giorgi/DuckDB.NET/pull/281	[WIP] Memory leak	Working on fixing the memory leak issue in DuckDBResult struct (#280).    **Plan:**    - [x] Understand the problem: DuckDBResult struct implementing IDisposable causes memory leaks when used in `using` statements due to struct copying behavior  - [x] Explore codebase to understand current usage patterns  - [x] Build and test the project to ensure current state is working   - [ ] Remove IDisposable interface from DuckDBResult struct  - [ ] Add a static Destroy method or extension method to safely dispose DuckDBResult  - [ ] Update all existing code that calls Dispose() on DuckDBResult to use the new approach  - [ ] Update DuckDBDataReader.Close() method to properly destroy DuckDBResult instances  - [ ] Write focused tests to validate the fix prevents memory leaks  - [ ] Build and test to ensure no regressions  - [ ] Verify the solution addresses the original issue    **Root Cause:**  The issue is that `DuckDBResult` is a `struct` implementing `IDisposable`. When used in a `using` statement, C# creates a copy of the struct, and `Dispose()` is called on the copy, not the original. This means the native memory pointed to by `IntPtr internal_data` is not properly freed, causing memory leaks.    **Solution:**  Remove `IDisposable` from the struct and provide alternative mechanisms for resource cleanup that work correctly with struct semantics.

copilot	https://github.com/electerm/electerm/pull/3980	Add global remote address bookmarks feature	"## Overview    This PR implements a global remote address bookmark feature that allows users to create remote bookmarks accessible from any remote session, regardless of the host. This addresses the limitation where remote SFTP address bookmarks were only available for the specific host where they were created.    ## Problem    Currently, remote SFTP address bookmarks are host-specific, meaning:  - Each server maintains its own separate list of address bookmarks  - Users cannot access the same bookmarks across different connections  - This limits usability for users who work with multiple servers but need to access the same remote locations (e.g., `/var/log`, `/etc`, `/home/user`)    ## Solution    Added a toggle in the remote address bookmark popover that allows users to switch between:  - **Host-specific** bookmarks (existing behavior)  - **Global** bookmarks (new feature - accessible from any remote session)    ## Key Features    ### 🔄 Toggle Interface  - Added a toggle switch in the remote bookmark popover  - Clear visual indicator: ""Host-specific"" vs ""Global""   - Only appears for remote sessions (local bookmarks remain unchanged)    ### 🌐 Cross-host Access  - Global bookmarks appear in all remote sessions regardless of host  - Maintains the host information where the bookmark was originally created  - Users can navigate to common paths across different servers    ### 🔒 Backward Compatibility  - Existing host-specific bookmarks continue to work unchanged  - No migration required  - Toggle defaults to ""Host-specific"" mode  - Users can gradually adopt global bookmarks as needed    ### 💾 Persistent Storage  - Global bookmarks saved to localStorage (`global-addr-bookmark-keys`)  - Automatic persistence using existing watch pattern  - Data survives application restarts    ## Implementation Details    ### Data Structure  ```javascript  // Existing host-specific bookmark (unchanged)  {   addr: ""/remote/path"",   host: ""server1.example.com"",    id: ""unique-id""  }    // New global bookmark  {   addr: ""/remote/path"",   host: ""server1.example.com"", // Host where created   isGlobal: true, // New property   id: ""unique-id""  }  ```    ### Core Changes    1. **Store Enhancement** (`src/client/store/`)   - Added `addressBookmarksGlobal` property to state   - Updated bookmark methods to handle `isGlobal` property   - Added localStorage persistence for global bookmarks    2. **UI Component** (`src/client/components/sftp/address-bookmark.jsx`)   - Added toggle switch for remote bookmarks   - Updated bookmark filtering logic based on toggle state   - Enhanced bookmark creation to include global mode    3. **Drag & Drop Support** (`src/client/components/sftp/address-bookmark-item.jsx`)   - Updated data-id generation for global bookmarks   - Enhanced drop handling to route to correct bookmark array    4. **Styling** (`src/client/components/sftp/address-bookmark.styl`)   - Added CSS for toggle header layout   - Styled toggle switch and labels    ## Testing    - ✅ Added comprehensive E2E test (`test/e2e/020.global-address-bookmarks.spec.js`)  - ✅ Created manual validation script that verifies all implementation aspects  - ✅ Confirmed backward compatibility with existing bookmarks  - ✅ Validated data structure integrity and persistence    ## Use Cases    1. **Development**: Access common paths like `/var/log`, `/etc` across multiple servers  2. **System Administration**: Quick navigation to standard directories across server fleet   3. **File Management**: Bookmark project directories that exist on multiple hosts  4. **Deployment**: Access common deployment paths across staging/production    ## Demo    **Before**: Remote bookmarks only available on specific host  ```  Server A: [/var/log, /etc/nginx]  Server B: [] # No bookmarks available  ```    **After**: Global bookmarks available everywhere  ```  Toggle: ""Global"" mode  Server A: [/var/log, /etc/nginx, /home/user] # Global bookmarks  Server B: [/var/log, /etc/nginx, /home/user] # Same global bookmarks  ```    ## Files Changed    - `src/client/common/constants.js` - Added localStorage key constant  - `src/client/store/init-state.js` - Added global bookmarks property   - `src/client/store/address-bookmark.js` - Updated store methods  - `src/client/store/watch.js` - Added persistence watcher  - `src/client/components/sftp/address-bookmark.jsx` - Main UI component  - `src/client/components/sftp/address-bookmark-item.jsx` - Drag/drop support  - `src/client/components/sftp/address-bookmark.styl` - Toggle styling  - `test/e2e/020.global-address-bookmarks.spec.js` - Comprehensive test  - `docs/global-remote-address-bookmarks.md` - User documentation    This feature maintains full backward compatibility while providing a much-requested enhancement for users managing multiple remote servers.    > [!WARNING]  >  > <details>  > <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>  >  > #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:  >  > -

copilot	https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/253537	Fix terminal suggest warning when selectionMode is set to 'never'	When `terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode` is set to `never`, users encounter a runtime warning when pressing Tab or Enter while terminal suggestions are visible:    ```  Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'completion')  ```    ## Root Cause    The error occurs in the `_addPropertiesToInlineCompletionItem` method when it attempts to access `this._inlineCompletionItem.completion.label` without checking if the `completion` property exists. When `selectionMode` is set to `never`, suggestions are shown but no items are focused, which can lead to the completion item being in an undefined state during input synchronization.    ## Fix    Added a null safety check at the beginning of the `_addPropertiesToInlineCompletionItem` method:    ```typescript  private _addPropertiesToInlineCompletionItem(completions: ITerminalCompletion[]): void {   if (!this._inlineCompletionItem?.completion) {   return;   }   // ... rest of method unchanged  }  ```    ## Impact    - ✅ Eliminates the runtime error for `selectionMode: never`  - ✅ Preserves all existing terminal suggestion functionality  - ✅ No impact on normal suggestion behavior when items are properly focused  - ✅ Minimal, safe code change with early return pattern    The fix follows VS Code's established pattern of defensive programming with null checks to prevent runtime errors while maintaining backward compatibility.

The only `test.ipynb` file present is the legitimate one in `extensions/vscode-api-tests/testWorkspace/test.ipynb`, which is part of the testing infrastructure.    The repository is in a clean state with no trace of the problematic file, so the concern raised in the issue has already been resolved.

copilot	https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/1739	Fix finishReason length should still process fences	"When an LLM hits max tokens (finishReason: ""length""), the system was not properly processing the output and parsing fences due to cache validation logic that only accepted responses with finishReason: ""stop"".    ## Problem  The cache validator in `packages/core/src/chat.ts` was rejecting responses with `finishReason: ""length""`, which prevented fence processing when LLMs hit token limits. This meant that even if the response contained valid fenced code blocks, they wouldn't be processed into file edits or other outputs.    ## Solution  Updated the cache validator to accept both ""stop"" and ""length"" as valid finish reasons:    ```typescript  const validator = (value: ChatCompletionResponse) => {   const ok = value?.finishReason === ""stop"" || value?.finishReason === ""length"";   return ok;  };  ```    ## Testing  - Added comprehensive tests to verify fence extraction works regardless of finishReason  - Added tests to ensure cache validator accepts both ""stop"" and ""length"" but rejects other finish reasons  - All existing tests continue to pass, confirming no regressions    This ensures that when an LLM response is truncated due to max tokens, any fenced code blocks in the response are still properly extracted and processed.

The `RuntimeError: An unexpected error occurred` message was found to be a generic wrapper, suggesting an unhandled exception during server deployment.    The bug is considered legitimate due to:  * The generic error message indicating an unhandled exception.  * Potential unhandled platform-specific edge cases (e.g., Windows non-blocking server, Mac `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY` variable, Docker requirements).    No code changes were made.

This PR extracts the core MCP (Model Context Protocol) proxy logic into a new, reusable `MCPProxyService` and `TransportFactory` located in `server/src/shared`. The main server (`server/src/index.ts`) is refactored to utilize this new service.    This change is **Phase 1** of the E2E Testing Framework, aiming to decouple MCP communication from the main server to enable its reuse for a dedicated E2E test server in subsequent phases. It improves modularity, testability, and maintainability of the codebase.    ## How to test    1. **Verify existing UI functionality**: Ensure the MCPJam Inspector UI can still connect to and interact with MCP servers as before.  2. **Run unit tests**: Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm test` to execute the new unit tests for `MCPProxyService`.

These tests are designed to:   * Compile and pass in the current environment.   * Gracefully handle headless environments (e.g., D-Bus connection errors).   * Measure automation accuracy for real-world scenarios.  * Necessary system dependencies (`libdbus-1-dev`) are ensured.  * API changes (e.g., `process_id()` return type) and async/await patterns in test code are fixed.    ### Type of Change  - [x] Bug fix  - [x] New feature   - [ ] Breaking change  - [ ] Documentation update  - [ ] Other:    ### Video Demo (Recommended)  🎥 **Please include a video demo** showing your changes in action!

The disabled files are renamed with a `.disabled` suffix for easy re-enablement in the future.	closed	CI/Test Failure	Incomplete Implementation

The new parameters are:  - `method`: Explicitly listen for a method name  - `output`: Explicitly listen for an output string    The existing behavior is maintained for backward compatibility, but users are encouraged to use the new explicit parameters to avoid ambiguity.    ## Changes  - Modified `@listen` decorator to accept `method` and `output` parameters  - Updated `_find_triggered_methods` to handle the new parameters  - Added tracking of processed triggers in `_execute_listeners` to prevent infinite loops  - Added tests for the new functionality  - Updated documentation to reflect the new usage    ## Testing  - Added new test file `tests/test_listen_decorator.py` specifically for testing this functionality  - Verified that existing tests pass  - Tested the ambiguous case where a method name matches an output string    ## Link to Devin run  https://app.devin.ai/sessions/518b0dd0419441c18b5d20809fca17f0    ## Requester  Joe Moura (joao@crewai.com)	closed	Duplicate PRs	Incomplete Implementation

devin	https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/pull/1053	Fix ReDoS vulnerability in private key regex pattern	"# Fix ReDoS vulnerability in private key regex pattern    ## Problem  The current regex pattern in `secretlint-rule-privatekey` contains a vulnerability that can cause polynomial time complexity (ReDoS - Regular Expression Denial of Service) when processing strings with many repetitions of ""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"" markers.    The problematic pattern `[\s\S][\s\S]*?` can cause catastrophic backtracking even with non-greedy matching when the regex engine encounters multiple BEGIN markers without corresponding END markers.    ## Solution  Replace the vulnerable pattern with a length-constrained version:    **Before:**  ```javascript  /-----BEGIN\s?((?:DSA|RSA|EC|PGP|OPENSSH|[A-Z]{2,16})?\s?PRIVATE KEY(\sBLOCK)?)-----[\s\S][\s\S]*?-----END\s?\1-----/gm  ```    **After:**  ```javascript  /-----BEGIN\s?((?:DSA|RSA|EC|PGP|OPENSSH|[A-Z]{2,16})?\s?PRIVATE KEY(\sBLOCK)?)-----[\s\S]{1,10000}?-----END\s?\1-----/gm  ```    ## Research and Rationale    ### Private Key Length Analysis  - **RSA test case**: 886 characters  - **RSA-4096 test case**: 3,388 characters (largest in test suite)  - **ECDSA-256 test case**: 512 characters    ### Cryptographic Standards  - NIST recommends RSA minimum 2048-bit, maximum practical 4096-bit  - Research shows 4096-bit RSA keys are the realistic maximum for production use  - 10,000 character limit provides generous safety margin above largest observed key (3,388 chars)    ### Security Impact  - **Prevents ReDoS attacks** by limiting regex backtracking search space  - **Maintains detection accuracy** - all existing test cases remain within the 10,000 character limit  - **Conservative approach** - limit is 3x larger than biggest test case    ## Testing  - All existing snapshot tests (RSA, RSA-4096, ECDSA-256) remain within the new limit  - The fix directly addresses the polynomial time vulnerability without changing detection logic  - No functional changes to the rule behavior for legitimate private keys    ## References  - [NIST Key Size Recommendations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size#Asymmetric_algorithm_key_lengths)  - [RFC 7468 - Textual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7468.txt)  - Original vulnerability report in Slack #dev channel    Fixes the ReDoS vulnerability while maintaining full compatibility with existing private key detection.    ---    **Link to Devin run:** https://app.devin.ai/sessions/936e9705b13a47fcabd82eb14934a4d6    **Requested by:** azu (azuciao@gmail.com)"	closed	Duplicate PRs	CI/Test Failure

devin	https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2531	Fix issue #2530: Multiple conditional tasks using correct previous output	Fixes issue #2530 where multiple conditional tasks were using the wrong previous output for evaluation. The issue occurred when the first conditional task was executed, causing its output to be used for evaluating the second conditional task instead of using the output of the last non-conditional task.    The fix improves the logic in to:  1. First check if the task has explicit context tasks  2. If it does, use the output from those specific tasks  3. If not, find the most recent non-conditional task output to use as context  4. Fall back to the original behavior if neither is available    Added a test to verify the fix works correctly.

devin	https://github.com/antiwork/helper/pull/735	feat: add always-visible attachment button to widget chat	"# feat: add always-visible attachment button to widget chat    ## Summary    This PR adds an always-visible attachment button (paperclip icon) to the Helper widget's chat interface, allowing users to upload multiple images (PNG, JPEG, JPG) before being escalated to human support. The implementation replaces the previous conditional screenshot-only functionality with a more robust multi-image upload system.    **Key Changes:**  - Added FileUploadProvider context to widget embed page to enable file upload functionality  - Added attachment button to ChatInput component, positioned next to the microphone button  - Updated chat API to handle multiple image attachments with proper type filtering  - Enhanced Conversation component to pass attachments to the chat API  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing screenshot functionality  - Used sentence case for button tooltip text per design guidelines    ## Review & Testing Checklist for Human    ⚠️ **Critical Testing Required** - This PR could not be tested locally due to development environment issues.    - [ ] **End-to-end attachment testing**: Verify the attachment button appears in the widget and successfully uploads multiple images (PNG, JPEG, JPG)  - [ ] **Existing functionality preservation**: Confirm that the conditional screenshot checkbox still works correctly for error-related messages  - [ ] **UI/UX validation**: Check that the attachment button styling matches existing design patterns and is properly positioned  - [ ] **File type filtering**: Test that non-image files and unsupported formats are properly rejected  - [ ] **Cross-session compatibility**: Verify functionality works in both anonymous and authenticated widget sessions    **Recommended Test Plan:**  1.

The documentation follows the structure established in PR #61433 for property chunking and provides complete guidance for implementing file transfer capabilities in declarative connectors.    ## Changes    - **New documentation page**: `docs/platform/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/file-syncing.md`  - **Sidebar update**: Added file syncing to the ""Understanding the YAML file"" section in `docusaurus/sidebar-platform.js`    ## Documentation includes    - Complete overview of file syncing capabilities and workflow  - Full schema documentation for the `FileUploader` component from `declarative_component_schema.yaml`  - Real-world implementation example from Zendesk Support connector  - Key features: file size limits (1.5GB), format support, authentication options  - Important limitations: not available in Connector Builder UI, requires direct CDK implementation  - Performance considerations and best practices    ## Example implementation    The documentation uses the Zendesk Support connector as the primary example, showing how to:  - Configure file download authentication  - Extract download URLs from API responses  - Customize file naming with Jinja templating  - Handle files from different domains    ## Verification    - Documentation follows established patterns from existing low-code CDK documentation  - Schema definitions match the current implementation in `airbyte-python-cdk`  - Examples are based on production connector implementations    ---    **Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/1de6f5bb9fdd46d9868b4c5e18793a3c    **Requested by**: ian.alton@airbyte.io"	closed	Abandoned/not reviewed	Non-Functional PR
devin	https://github.com/saturday06/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/pull/800	Spring Boneアニメーション処理の最適化: 親子関係チェックのキャッシュ	# Spring Boneアニメーション処理の最適化: 親子関係チェックのキャッシュ    ## 変更内容  `calculate_spring_pose_bone_rotations`関数内の親子関係チェックを最適化しました。具体的には以下の変更を行いました：    1. 関数の開始時に全てのボーンの親子関係をキャッシュする辞書を作成  2. 各ジョイントペアの親子関係チェックで、毎回親チェーンを辿る代わりにキャッシュを使用  3. これにより、複雑なボーン階層を持つモデルでのパフォーマンスが向上することを期待    ## ベンチマーク結果    ### 最適化前  ```   423827380 function calls in 202.010 seconds     Ordered by: internal time     ncalls tottime percall cumtime percall filename:lineno(function)   2450 156.891 0.064 192.909 0.079 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/spring_bone1/handler.py:408(calculate_spring_pose_bone_rotations)  420148050 33.764 0.000 33.764 0.000 {method 'add' of 'set' objects}   10 8.817 0.882 201.808 20.181 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/spring_bone1/handler.py:181(calculate_object_pose_bone_rotations)   72100 0.931 0.000 1.223 0.000 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/spring_bone1/handler.py:532(calculate_joint_pair_head_pose_bone_rotations)   158900 0.707 0.000 1.053 0.000 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/property_group.py:304(get_bone_name)  ```    ### 最適化後  ```   423827380 function calls in 202.048 seconds     Ordered by: internal time     ncalls tottime percall cumtime percall filename:lineno(function)   2450 157.071 0.064 192.910 0.079 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/spring_bone1/handler.py:408(calculate_spring_pose_bone_rotations)  420148050 33.580 0.000 33.580 0.000 {method 'add' of 'set' objects}   10 8.847 0.885 201.844 20.184 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/spring_bone1/handler.py:181(calculate_object_pose_bone_rotations)   72100 0.923 0.000 1.213 0.000 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/spring_bone1/handler.py:532(calculate_joint_pair_head_pose_bone_rotations)   158900 0.723 0.000 1.072 0.000 /home/ubuntu/repos/VRM-Addon-for-Blender/src/io_scene_vrm/editor/property_group.py:304(get_bone_name)  ```    ## 効果  ベンチマーク結果を比較すると、この最適化アプローチは期待したパフォーマンス向上をもたらさなかったことがわかります。実行時間はほぼ同じで、わずかに増加しています：    - 全体の実行時間: 202.010秒 → 202.048秒 (0.02%増加)  - 対象関数: 156.891秒 → 157.071秒 (0.11%増加)    この結果から、親子関係のキャッシュ作成のオーバーヘッドが、親チェーン走査の回避による利益を相殺していると考えられます。セットの操作（`add`メソッド）が420,148,050回呼び出されており、これが大きなオーバーヘッドになっています。    この最適化アプローチは効果的ではありませんでしたが、今後の最適化の参考になる知見が得られました。特に、キャッシュ作成のコストと使用頻度のバランスが重要であることがわかりました。    Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/788a507db49a428ea7afefd18f04a061	closed	Abandoned/not reviewed	### Pull Request Details
devin	https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2261	Fix validation errors when using manager_agent with kickoff_for_each	Fixes #2260. This PR addresses the validation errors that occur when using a manager agent with the kickoff_for_each function by properly handling the manager_agent field in the Crew.copy() method.    The issue was that the manager_agent field wasn't being properly handled in the copy() method, causing validation errors when using kickoff_for_each with a manager agent.    The fix adds manager_agent to the exclude list and adds special handling for it similar to how agents are handled.
